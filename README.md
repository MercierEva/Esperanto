An app to analyse Sequencing Data from ONT technology.

This app allows to browse or drag and drop some fastq files. The user may choose few parameters to filter data. 

Then, all that remains is to launch the program. 

The workflow in the background is building with snakemake.
The result is a sequence Fasta consensus with or without the variant calling and a statistical report.
